# 3d-pose-rs
3D-Pose-RS is a Rust implementation of 3D human pose estimation models, focusing on the SMPL (Skinned Multi-Person Linear) model. This project aims to provide efficient and accurate 3D human pose and shape estimation capabilities for Rust applications.
Features

SMPL model implementation in Rust
Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) for pose deformation
Vertex joint selection for additional keypoints
Batch processing support for efficient computations
Support for hand and feet keypoints
